# How to sign transaction using backend wallet

There are many cases when it's required to sign a transaction on backend.
Use cases:

- NFT vending machine - ming token and send to user when the address get funded
- Off chain bot that withdraw funds from a contract.

In both cases you may want to define a wallet on your backend to be able to sign those txs.
Here is a code reference on how it's done in dAppstep repo:
https://github.com/nirvanush/dappstep-play/blob/main/src/services/WalletFromMnemonics.ts

#### And here is how you can use it in your app:

```javascript
import SignerWallet from '../src/services/WalletFromMnemonics';

// example tx
const unsignedTx = {
  inputs: [...], 
  outputs: [...],
  ...
}

// You should never write the seedphrase in your code, always use a secret manager.
const wallet = await new SignerWallet().fromMnemonics('add your seed phrase of 12 words here');

const signedTx = wallet.sign(unsignedTx);

// Now you can submit this tx to mempool

```
